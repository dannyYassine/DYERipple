# DYRipple
Creating a nice ripple animation.

/*****************************

    Heres how to use it:

    let rippleView = DYRipple(frame: CGRectMake(location.x - 75.0, location.y - 75.0, 150.0, 150.0), animation: 0.75, withGreen:false)
    superView.addSubView(rippleView)

    Thats it!

    The ripple will animate, expanding while fading out, and removing it self from its superview.
